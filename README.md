# Title: Peptide Detection Using Convolution Neural Network

## Abstract:
Beside genome sequencing, quantitative proteomics is one of the most useful tools in
modern biological and medical research. Mass Spectrometry (MS) allows the complete
molecular characterization of proteomic samples which can be treated as images.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used for visual recognition tasks.
This project aimed at processing MS spectra images for peptide feature detection
using CNNâ€™s ability for solving localization and semantic segmentation problems.

## CNN architecutre known as U-Net [1]
U-Net with five levels of resolution was used during this project.
